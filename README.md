## SwiftUI Overview
SwiftUI is a declarative framework for building apps for any Apple platform. Use SwiftUI to define the UI and behavior of an app using a single language and common API.

Create apps more quickly and with fewer errors with these key SwiftUI features:

Declarative syntax — Define what views appear on screen using simple Swift structures. Your views stay up to date automatically.

A compositional API — Quickly create and iterate your UI using built-in views and modifiers. Compose more complex views by combining simpler views.

A powerful layout system — When existing views and controls don’t suit your needs, you can draw your own.

Views that reflect app data — Define a view’s data dependencies, and SwiftUI automatically updates the view when data changes, avoiding errors from invalid view states.

Automatic accessibility support — SwiftUI adds basic accessibility that you’ll learn to enhance with minimal effort.
